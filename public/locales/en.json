      "“Recently I have discoverd the game crokinole and wanted to have a board of my own. By doing some research online I saw a lot of reviews in forums/youtube. Most of the time woodestic was praised as having the best crokinole board in europe.\nVisiting your website convinced me indeed that woodestic stands for quality & passion.\nThe board it self and the way you can compose it with all possible options blows away the competition and the board it self looks of very high quality!”\n\n~ Luis",

Seriously thank you for the excellent customer service, you make a wonderful product but your service levels are above and beyond many that I have experienced in my life.“\n\n~ Robert",
      "“The board itself is even more wonderful in real life than in the pictures. I'm really happy about my choice for the pattern and the colors.\n\nSince receiving the board, I have played it will children >6 years, with 'hard core' board gamers, with my non-gamer partner, and with grandparents. Everyone loves it. In terms of board games, this is unique to me.\n\nThe board has a prominent place in my living room. I will send you a picture directly after this email.\n\nLooking forward to playing and cherishing this board for many more years.”\n\n~Wouter, Netherlands, Crokinole Elite",
